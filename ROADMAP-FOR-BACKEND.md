# Backend-Focused .NET Roadmap

This roadmap guides you through backend development with C# and .NET, focusing on modern best practices, APIs, data, and deployment.

## 1. Core Backend Concepts

- HTTP, REST, and Web APIs
- JSON serialization/deserialization
- Routing and Controllers
- Dependency Injection
- Middleware

## 2. Building APIs with ASP.NET Core

- Creating and configuring a Web API project
- Defining controllers and actions
- Model binding and validation
- Using Entity Framework Core for data access
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Authentication and Authorization (JWT, Identity)
- Error handling and logging
- Versioning APIs
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

## 3. Data and Persistence

- Working with databases (SQL Server, SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Migrations and seeding
- Repository and Unit of Work patterns
- Connection strings and configuration

## 4. Advanced Backend Topics

- Background services and Worker Services
- Caching (in-memory, distributed)
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Asynchronous programming in web APIs
- Testing APIs (unit, integration, and end-to-end)
- Secure API design and best practices

## 5. Deployment and Operations

- Publishing and deploying .NET apps (IIS, Azure, Docker, Linux)
- Environment-based configuration
- Monitoring and health checks
- CI/CD basics for .NET projects

**Tip:** Check off each topic as you learn and practice it!

## Example: Minimal ASP.NET Core Web API (C#)

```csharp
// Program.cs (top-level statements)
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddControllers();
var app = builder.Build();
app.MapControllers();
app.Run();
```

---

## Example: Classic Controller (C#)

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class WeatherController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult Get() => Ok(new { Temp = 25, Condition = "Sunny" });
}
```
