# C#/.NET Mobile App Development Roadmap

This roadmap will guide you through learning and building mobile apps using .NET and C# (primarily with .NET MAUI, the modern cross-platform framework for Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS).

## 1. Getting Started

- Install Visual Studio 2022+ with .NET MAUI workload
- Understand what .NET MAUI is and supported platforms
- Set up Android/iOS emulators or connect real devices
- Learn C# basics if new to the language

## 2. Project Structure and Fundamentals

- Create a new .NET MAUI project
- Explore the folder structure (Platforms, Resources, Views, Models, etc.)
- Understand the MVU (Model-View-Update) and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) patterns
- Learn about XAML for UI design

## 3. Building User Interfaces

- Layouts: StackLayout, Grid, FlexLayout, etc.
- Controls: Button, Entry, Label, ListView, CollectionView, etc.
- Data binding and commands
- Styles, themes, and resources
- Navigation (Shell, NavigationPage, TabbedPage)

## 4. Working with Data

- Local storage (Preferences, File System, SQLite)
- Consuming REST APIs (HttpClient, JSON serialization)
- Displaying and updating data in the UI
- Data validation

## 5. Platform Features and APIs

- Accessing device sensors (GPS, camera, accelerometer)
- Permissions and platform-specific code
- Notifications (local and push)
- Using plugins and NuGet packages

## 6. Advanced Topics

- Dependency injection in .NET MAUI
- Custom renderers/handlers for platform-specific UI
- Animations and transitions
- Localization and globalization
- Accessibility best practices

## 7. Testing and Debugging

- Debugging on emulators and real devices
- Unit testing and UI testing (e.g., with xUnit, NUnit, Appium)
- Performance profiling

## 8. Building and Publishing

- Building APKs (Android), IPAs (iOS), and app packages (Windows/macOS)
- App signing and certificates
- Store requirements (Google Play, App Store, Microsoft Store)
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) basics

## 9. Best Practices

- Code organization and naming conventions
- Using Git for version control
- Clean architecture and separation of concerns
- Reusable components and libraries
- Keeping dependencies up to date

## 10. Next Steps

- Explore advanced topics (background tasks, offline sync, custom controls)
- Contribute to open-source MAUI projects
- Join the .NET MAUI and mobile dev community

## Example: Simple .NET MAUI Page (C#)

```csharp
using Microsoft.Maui.Controls;

public class MainPage : ContentPage
{
    public MainPage()
    {
        Content = new VerticalStackLayout
        {
            Children =
            {
                new Label { Text = "Hello, .NET MAUI!" },
                new Button { Text = "Click Me" }
            }
        };
    }
}
```
