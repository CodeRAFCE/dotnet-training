# C#/.NET Game Development Roadmap

## 1. Getting Started

- Install Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code
- Install a game engine (Unity is the most popular for C#)
- Learn about C# basics if new to the language

## 2. Game Engine Fundamentals

- Unity Editor basics (scenes, assets, prefabs, hierarchy, inspector)
- Understanding GameObjects and Components
- Using the Asset Store
- Project structure and organization

## 3. C# Scripting for Games

- Writing and attaching scripts to GameObjects
- MonoBehaviour lifecycle methods (Start, Update, FixedUpdate, etc.)
- Variables, methods, and events in Unity scripts
- Input handling (keyboard, mouse, touch)
- Coroutines and timing

## 4. Game Mechanics

- Physics and collisions
- Movement and animation
- UI development (Canvas, Text, Buttons, Sliders)
- Audio (sound effects, music)
- Camera control
- Particle systems and effects

## 5. Advanced Game Development

- Scene management and transitions
- Saving and loading data (PlayerPrefs, files, serialization)
- Object pooling
- ScriptableObjects for data management
- Multiplayer basics (Photon, Mirror, Unity Netcode)
- Performance optimization

## 6. Asset Management

- Importing and using 2D/3D assets
- Materials, shaders, and lighting
- Animation controllers and blend trees

## 7. Testing and Debugging

- Debugging scripts in Unity
- Using the Unity Profiler
- Writing unit tests for game logic

## 8. Building and Publishing

- Building for different platforms (PC, mobile, web, console)
- Platform-specific settings and optimizations
- Submitting to app stores or game platforms

## 9. Best Practices

- Code organization and naming conventions
- Version control with Git (and Unity's .gitignore)
- Modular and reusable code
- Working in teams (collaboration tools)

## 10. Next Steps

- Participate in game jams
- Contribute to open-source Unity projects
- Explore advanced topics (AI, procedural generation, VR/AR)
- Join the Unity and game dev community
